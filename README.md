# Local Library

## Overview

**Local Library** is a **NestJS Framework** WebApp made in order to "better learn" mongoose. 
The main involved technologies are TypeScript, Mongo (with Mongoose ODM) and Node.

When i decided to learn mongoDB (mongoose in particular), i came across an example/tutorial in MDN Web documentation
site that caught my attention for the topics covered:
[Express Tutorial: The Local Library website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)

So i decided to work on this project using the best practices i've learnt in years in node based architectures and
to came up with a strong and clean solution.
